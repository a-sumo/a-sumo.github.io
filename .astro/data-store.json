Because the range of expression is limited. We need to think of electronic music as a new set of tools. DAWs aren’t the point. The point is that we have synthesizer that allow us to achieve sounds that are irreproducible with natural instruments.\nSampling also play a huge role in enabling access  and manipulation to any natural or synthesized sound.One would think that such an increase in creative freedom would result in more masterpieces being produced.Is it the case? I’ve never listened to an EDM song and felt like it was a masterpiece. Outstanding, evocative, anything, but never masterpieces. Why? Because the producer themselves always seemed to be trying different stuff out and seeing what sticks. It could be felt. Now, \n[Claude 4]\nMusic is far more abstract. There's no \"musical survival instinct\" the way there is for vision. While we might have some innate responses to rhythm (as you noted with hip-hop beats), the appreciation of harmonic relationships, voice leading, and contrapuntal structure is entirely learned. When Bach moves from one key to another, or when he creates tension through a diminished chord, you have to have internalized a cultural system of musical meaning to feel the significance.\nRaphael can be universally appreciated while a Bach can’t. Bach fugue requires cultural education. Raphael is appreciated even more by the painter or critic, but the general public still recognizes its harmony.Suppsoedly this is because we’re hardwire to process visual information for survival. When we watch raphael we’re using the same neural pathways involved in navigating the world every day.\nBut I’d argue that the same goes for music. We have a sound survival instinct, we know the connotation of rhythms. We can tell a singing bird apart from a growl, a hopping deer apart from tiger paws. We can tell the emotional state from the rhythm and pitch. why because of our experiences.[Me]\nEverytime you’d want a shade, you’d have to stop and make a chemical procedure to get it.\nWe do have a music survival instinct, based on real world sounds and their connotation. so perhaps we just don't have the right tools YET to bring nature into a medium where it can be assembled and abstracted and composed in ways that form an art form. in classical music, we have a very abstract, straight lines with few colors representation of the world, which has lead to masterful world, but still limited in universal evocativenes. and in more modern electronic musicwe have collages of high resolution pictures, but they lack cohesiveness and flow. why? because we don't have the tools for it. we have samplers but no truly intuitive general purpose synthesizers. it's as if we asked raphael to produce a pigment by manipulating some very unintuitive process such that they would either just get the pigment already made, but Struggle to harmonize it with the composition, or use that unintuitive process and spend so much energy creating the pigment that they would have little left to think about the composition as a whole. and give the whole composition the same amount of attention and energy.\n[Claude]\nWe might need something like a \"sonic paintbrush\" - interfaces that let musicians think directly in terms of natural sound qualities rather than technical parameters. Until we have that, we're stuck with either the limited but coherent palette of classical music, or the vast but unwieldy sonic possibilities of electronic music.\n\n[Claude Summary]\nThe Central Thesis: Electronic music hasn't produced masterpieces because of a fundamental mismatch between human musical intuition and current technological interfaces.\nThe Thread:\n1. Universal Musical Instinct Exists: Contrary to common belief, humans do have innate musical responses rooted in survival - we recognize emotional states through rhythm and pitch, distinguish threatening sounds from benign ones, and respond physically to certain sonic patterns. This suggests music could theoretically be as universally accessible as visual art.\n2. Classical Music's Limited but Coherent Expression: Traditional instruments, while sonically limited, maintain an intuitive relationship between physical gesture and sonic result. This coherence allowed masters like Bach to achieve deep structural sophistication within their constrained palette - like master painters working with a limited but well-understood set of pigments.\n3. Electronic Music's Paradox of Abundance: Modern tools offer unprecedented sonic possibilities through synthesis and sampling, yet this expansion hasn't yielded proportional artistic advancement. The medium feels exploratory rather than masterful.\n4. The Interface Problem: Current synthesizers require producers to think in abstract technical parameters (oscillators, filters, envelopes) rather than natural sonic qualities. This creates cognitive overhead that diverts creative energy from composition to sound design - like forcing Raphael to perform complex chemistry every time he wants a specific hue.\n5. The Missing Link: We need \"sonic paintbrushes\" - interfaces that allow direct manipulation of natural sound characteristics rather than technical parameters. Only then can electronic music achieve the coherent mastery that classical music achieved within its constraints.\nThe Underlying Pattern: Each medium reaches artistic maturity when its tools become transparent extensions of human intuition rather than obstacles to expression.\n\n[Me, in depth analysis]\nNow, what would that missing link look like?I think it would need to verify some criteria:\n1. intuitiveness:\n2. universality\n3. focus, compacness\n\n1. intuitiveness, i have to be able to tell which sound is being produced from galcing at the interface. [1]\n2. universality: the interface must allow to reach a sufficiently rich breadth of sounds within a sufficien short reach and ideally with intuitive transition landscape. \nin the same sense as color pigments define a color gamut\n\nUniversality:\nWe have first glimpses of this through neural synthesis, which enables interpolation between sounds, regardless of their type, but again. to underpin or reinforce this, here should be an opinionated space of sounds features that are most evocative to the ear. \nwe’ll use the color wheel as our guiding example.\nThe dimensions a painter navigates, those which matter the most to the perceptual organ of the viewer are hue, saturation and value. All combinations of pigments can be summed up as variation of amount along either one of these dimensions, or directions.\n What would be the equivalent for audio?\nPitch and intensity are no brainers. \nSince pitch determines an abstract property of elevation and tone, its correlate would be saturation. The higher the pitch, the brighter the sound.Intensity on the other hand determines the abstract property saliency, so its correlate would be value.\nA less obvious dimension is that of texture, whose correlate would be hue.\nperhaps this is where VAEs might come into the play. their problem is that they’re not intuitive. at least,  not right off the bat. we get 2. at the cost of 1. 3. Compactness\nThe artist must have an compact, enclosed space, a playground with simple tools that encourages experimentation while reducing distractions. \n\n\nnotes:\n1. I don’t mean in the sense of a spectrum or waveform, but in a deeper sense, in the sense of a percept. that is, that which emerges from the initial layers of processing of direct sensory perception. \n2. Now, it isn’t because there are 3 dimensions that we will consciously navigate some 3-dimensional cube. This would be a misconception.No painter thinks in terms of the full flegedcolorspace, but rather in terms of each feature, one at the time. They generally work on saliency first. Then, they think in terms of masses of hue. Finally, they think in terms of \n\nWhat might it look like?I think it will be an interface grounded in some real world process that generates sound, whose dynamics are intuitive to us. A windpipe comes up as a suitable candidate. Air comumn manipulation is something we’re adept with since it’s the main mechanism involved in produce our voice. This would provide ample intuitiveness.To achieve universality, I would suggest a way to go beyond the natural sounds into artificial ones while maintaining intuitiveness, or in other words, physical plausibility. This sounds a lot like extrapolation, or hallucination. We would need to hallucinate the air manipulation scenario that might produce exotic sounds such as a pure saw wave.There would also need to be a temporal aspect to this. As we would need to perform variations in time that yield the complex waveshaping dynamics ones found in modern synthesizers.\nThe extrapolation should not reduce intuitiveness. Venturing into non physical domain should not be too unsettling.\nTo achieve compactness, we would need a simple set of cardinal textures, that would act as our pigments. \nThis pigment set would need to verify\n- mixing potential\n- harmony\n- complementarity\nWe should be able to compose multiple textures to achieve the desired one, without resorting to texture synthesis.Now, mixing doesn’t always take the form of interpolation. If it does, then the dimension along which we interpolate must be specified. It seems that sound mixing, much like pigment mixing is substractive. When too many pigments aresuperimposed, the resulting color is said to be “muddy”, and the same applies to sound mixes.\nThere should also be some notion of complementarity. In the sense that there ought to be textures that have a complementary relationship. What that means is that from an experiential standpoint, their composition results in a net neutrality. Since we’re dealing with sounds, this composition would be sequential.\n\nThe model of additive synthesis fails to respect the compactness condition because too many components are required to produce the desired texture. Wavetable synthesis gets us closer, but it fails to verify intuitivenss. It isn’t quite intuitive , especially for the non expert, to know what set of combinations would yield a specific waveform, especially if it evolves through time. If we take the example of a human voice, without sampling actual voice waveforms, one would have quite a hard time reproducing its spectral components. For this reason it’s generally not done. This leads us into another key aspect of compactness, which is avoidance of distractions. We’d like to reduce time spent on isolated subjects, atomised experiences, unless it’s intentional, in the context of a study.\nBut again, the study’s output will not be directly integrated into the composition. The study allows the development of skill that is later on put into use on the canvas once necessary.\n\n","src/content/blog/post1.md","73b2341d9eb00aa9",{"html":25,"metadata":26},"\u003Ch1 id=\"colors-sounds-percepts\">Colors, Sounds, Percepts\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>The electronic music medium has not been mastered to the same extent as classical music, where true masters made civilization defining pieces.\nWhy?
