# Colors


I’ve been considering the design of sound manipulation tools that respect some core criteria:
1. intuitiveness:
2. universality
3. compacness

1. intuitiveness, i have to be able to tell which sound is being produced from glancing at the interface. [1]
2. universality: the interface must allow to reach a sufficiently rich breadth of sounds within a sufficien short reach and ideally with intuitive transition landscape. 
in the same sense as color pigments define a color gamut

Universality:
We have first glimpses of this through neural synthesis, which enables interpolation between sounds, regardless of their type, but again. to underpin or reinforce this, here should be an opinionated space of sounds features that are most evocative to the ear. 
we’ll use the color wheel as our guiding example.
We may separate into hue, saturation and value. All combinations of pigments can be summed up as variation of amount along either one of these dimensions, or directions.
What would be the equivalent for audio?
Since pitch determines an abstract property of elevation and tone, its correlate would be saturation. The higher the pitch, the brighter the sound.Intensity on the other hand determines saliency, so its correlate would be value.
Hue may capture the timbral properties of sound. 3. Compactness
The artist must have an compact, enclosed space, a playground with simple tools that encourages experimentation while reducing distractions. I think it will be an interface grounded in some real world process that generates sound, whose dynamics are intuitive to us. A windpipe comes up as a suitable candidate. Air comumn manipulation is something we’re adept with since it’s the main mechanism involved in produce our voice. This would provide ample intuitiveness.To achieve universality, I would suggest a way to go beyond the natural sounds into artificial ones while maintaining intuitiveness, or in other words, physical plausibility. This sounds a lot like extrapolation, or hallucination. We would need to hallucinate the air manipulation scenario that might produce exotic sounds such as a pure saw wave.There would also need to be a temporal aspect to this. As we would need to perform variations in time that yield the complex waveshaping dynamics ones found in modern synthesizers.
The extrapolation should not reduce intuitiveness. Venturing into non physical domain should not be too unsettling.
To achieve compactness, we would need a starting set of cardinal textures, that would act as our pigments. 
This pigment set would need to verify
- mixing potential
- harmony
- complementarity
We should be able to compose multiple textures to achieve the desired one, without resorting to texture synthesis.Now, mixing doesn’t always take the form of interpolation. If it does, then the dimension along which we interpolate must be specified. It seems that sound mixing, much like pigment mixing is substractive. When too many pigments aresuperimposed, the resulting color is said to be “muddy”, and the same applies to sound mixes.
There should also be some notion of complementarity. In the sense that there ought to be textures that have a complementary relationship. What that means is that from an experiential standpoint, their composition results in a net neutrality. Since we’re dealing with sounds, this composition would be sequential.

The model of additive synthesis fails to respect the compactness condition because too many components are required to produce the desired texture. Wavetable synthesis gets us closer, but it fails to verify intuitivenss. It isn’t quite intuitive , especially for the non expert, to know what set of combinations would yield a specific waveform, especially if it evolves through time. If we take the example of a human voice, without sampling actual voice waveforms, one would have quite a hard time reproducing its spectral components. For this reason it’s generally not done. This leads us into another key aspect of compactness, which is avoidance of distractions. We’d like to reduce time spent on isolated subjects, atomised experiences, unless it’s intentional, in the context of a study.
But again, the study’s output will not be directly integrated into the composition. The study allows the development of skill that is later on put into use on the canvas once necessary.
