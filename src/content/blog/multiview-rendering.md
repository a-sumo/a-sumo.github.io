This project converts a series of depth map images from different viewpoints into a volumetric representation using OpenVDB. It processes images from six different views (nx, ny, nz, px, py, pz) and combines them into a single volumetric dataset.

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l);
  return true;
};
```
