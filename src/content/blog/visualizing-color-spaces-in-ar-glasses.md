1. Juggling between hue, saturation and value is hard

Suppose I'm mixing colors on a palette. Each decision I make is going to move the drops of paint across three key dimensions: hue, saturation and value. 
Managing these three dimensions is no easy task. Why? Because pigments themselves aren't separate in hue, saturation and value.
Note. 
In technical terms, mixing two pigments is an operation that involves two 
Generally, an artist will begin with identifying value masses. Painting can be defined as the process of shaping the attention of a viewer. Value defines salience.
Generally, adding darker colors will decrease value and lighter colors will decrease values, but doing so will also move you across the hue and saturation dimensions. 
You can't magically isolate these dimensions. You may guess that this multidimensional navigation, which experienced painters perform seamlessly, is pretty can get quite frustrating for someone new.
I've personally thrown away a few unfinished paintings because I couldn't get the colors I wanted, no matter how hard I tried. I also had no way of knowing which pigments I needed. Each new pigment introduced more complexity. If I decided to use only a few pigments at the time, then I needed to know identify whether the pigments in 
They develop an intuition for how specific pigments will interact with one another across these three different dimensions. 
This is an outstanding skill that I personally would love to master.
The process of learning it is sacred, and I want in no way to take that away from anyone. However, the frustration that this process may cause and the dropout rate are not necessary.

Hence, I need to find a way to see what's happening in those abstract spaces concretely. I need a seeing tool.
