AR Engineer with a background in Frontend Web Development and 3D Computer Graphics.

I'm concerned with building non-invasive interfaces that encourage individuals to connect both with the world around them and the world within their minds.

Outside of work: sci-fi novels, oil painting, electronic music, hip-hop dancing, and contemplative practice.
