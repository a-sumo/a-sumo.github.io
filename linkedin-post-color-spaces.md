# LinkedIn Post - Visualizing Color Spaces in AR

I've just released a blog post that dives into the challenges I've faced when learning to mix oil and acrylic paint.

These difficulties prompted me to think of a way to use augmented reality glasses to make the learning process more enjoyable and color theory less opaque.

Here I specifically get into seeing spaces, particularly color spaces, and how they can help us see what happens when pigments are mixed together and guide our creative process.

The article includes an interactive color mixing challenge, the rendering workflows I've settled on, and some lessons learned along the way.

It was a fun adventure, and at many points I wondered if what I intended to do was possible at all. Turns out, it was! As of December 2025, we actually have a full-fledged AR engine coupled with fully-featured AR glasses and tons of resources to turn ideas into reality.

Here's the link to the article and code and a short demo I recorded earlier today, built with Lens Studio and run on 2024 Snap Inc. Spectacles.

Hope you enjoy! 😁
